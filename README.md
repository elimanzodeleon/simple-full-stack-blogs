This is a full stack MERN application. Any user is allowed to create or delete any post, i.e. there is no user authentication.

I created this project to get familiar with getting my own Node.js backend working with a Next.js front end.

## Front End

The front end was built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Back End

The back end was built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
